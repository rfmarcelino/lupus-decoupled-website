## About Gitpod

Gitpod is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that allows developers to work on their code projects collaboratively and efficiently. The online demo is built using [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) and its Drupal integration, [DrupalPod](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/development-tools/drupalpod/getting-started)


Gitpod provides 50 hours per month for free, so you can just log in via GitHub and give it a try!


## Launch

Launch one of the following environments:

- [Lupus Decoupled Drupal - 1.x-dev with Drupal 10 & Nuxt 3](https://gitpod.io/#DP_PROJECT_NAME=lupus_decoupled,DP_ISSUE_BRANCH=1.x,DP_PROJECT_TYPE=project_module,DP_MODULE_VERSION=1.x,DP_CORE_VERSION=10.0.0,DP_PATCH_FILE=,FRONTEND_REPOSITORY=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdrunomics%2Flupus-decoupled-nuxt3-demo,DP_INSTALL_PROFILE=standard/https://github.com/drunomics/lupus-decoupled-project) (latest, recommended)

The environment takes a couple of minutes to launch and logs you into Drupal. Try adding some content nodes and menu items to see it working and continue with your [first steps](/get-started/first-steps)
