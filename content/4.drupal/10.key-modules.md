## Further Useful Drupal modules

Besides the main modules the following Drupal modules are useful:

 * [Rest menu items](https://drupal.org/project/rest_menu_items) provides a way to easily
   fetch Drupal menus. The Nuxt.js Drupal module comes with built-in support for it.
 * [Trusted redirect](https://www.drupal.org/project/trusted_redirect) allows the frontend
   to link to Drupal while setting a `trusted_destination=<frontend>` redirect target.
 * [Site per path](https://www.drupal.org/project/site_per_path) allows to easily setup
   path-based redirects that can direct users to the frontend, e.g. for all "node/1234"
   routes.
 * [Services env parameter](https://www.drupal.org/project/services_env_parameter) to 
   set cookie domain or CORS configuration via environment variables.
